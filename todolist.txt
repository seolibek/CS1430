For the alpha beta blending..:


For the aging model:
Finish models.py, losses.py (easier, should take around 30 more min)
Edit test_functions.py (donâ€™t need video stuff, because we are working w only images. This will be far simpler than what they have) (maybe like an hour)
Write our version of train.py (this will take awhile)

run train.py then debug. can probbaly move this entire repo to oscar and train there, bc we not dependant on notebooks (good sign)
